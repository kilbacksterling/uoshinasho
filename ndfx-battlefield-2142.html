I understand that some of you don't like futuristic setting but for those who do we could try to get enough players together to get a game together. If enough people are interested I'll set up a discord for it. https://youtu.be/nWFpK9k_maI. I remember growing up, this was one of my favorite games to play. I don't know how this community feels about this particular title, but I just rediscovered it and am disappointed to hear EA shut down the servers for it a few years ago.

People on the other team would LOSE their shit, sometimes would come hunt me, but Id already exfilled to hide spot 2. I would watch. Hi. What do you think about it?

In Battlefield 2142 we had to capture silos to destroy the enemie's ship shield then invade it to destroy it or keep controlling the silos until the ship goes down, if the new game mode is somehow like that it would be amazing, since Dennis said we would capture command posts and destroy capital ships, the bf2142 idea popped in my mind and it would be a blast Was just discussing this in the comments with another Oculus reddit member, and was curious how realistic this is, conceptually.
